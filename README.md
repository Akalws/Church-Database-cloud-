# Cloud Database
# Overview

This is a simple database for the church of Jesus Christ Of latter saints. It contains 8 tables and a couple of columns. It is a Relational Database which has some random name of members and callings that  church members has. I is also connected to Amazon web services(cloud) which makes it easy to access. I also used the SQL workbench for the database. Please find the link below.
